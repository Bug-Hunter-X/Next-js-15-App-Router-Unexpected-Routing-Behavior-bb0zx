# Next.js 15 App Router Unexpected Routing Behavior

This repository demonstrates an unexpected routing behavior in Next.js 15's app directory.  When navigating between pages, the application sometimes exhibits unexpected transitions or fails to update the UI correctly.

## Bug Description

The bug manifests as inconsistent routing behavior. For example, navigating from one page to another might result in the old page's content remaining visible or the new page's content being displayed incorrectly.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Navigate between pages within the application.  Observe the inconsistent transitions.

## Expected Behavior

The application should smoothly and correctly transition between pages, accurately reflecting the current route.

## Actual Behavior

Inconsistent or incorrect transitions occur during navigation.

## Solution

This issue is resolved by ensuring the correct use of the layout and page components in the app directory. The solution file (bugSolution.js) includes improved structure that demonstrates this fix.  More importantly, checking for and resolving any potential conflicts between your layout, pages and the client-side routing is key.
